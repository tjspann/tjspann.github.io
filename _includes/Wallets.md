A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, they more often also offer the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information. Most exchanges and websites have their own wallets, though sometimes you can log in with your own wallet address.

  - [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): Metamask is available on PC via browser extensions so if you'd like to be able to use your wallet from your desktop this is a good choice. Also nobody pointed out to me lots of sites and dApps support just logging in with Metamask... which allows seperate wallets for everything.
  - [Tronlink](https://www.tronlink.org): Tron Blockchain dApp Wallet. This one also allows wallet login on supported sites.
