A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, they more often also offer the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information. Most exchanges and websites have their own wallets, though sometimes you can log in with your own wallet address.

* Faucet Wallets
  
  - [Express Crypto](https://expresscrypto.io/signup?referral=156563): This is the microwallet for a simply staggering number of faucet sites. If you plan to make any money on faucets at all, this wallet is a must have. 
  
  - [Coinpot](https://coinpot.co): This microwallet serves fewer sites than Express Crypto, but seems to have fairly competitive payout rates overall. I've read some bad reviews but they credited my wallet address when I made a withdrawal.
  
* Game / Application Walltes
  
  - [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): Metamask is a wallet and decentralized app, or dapp, browser. Expect a deeper dive when I have more time to review it. üê±‚Äçüë§
