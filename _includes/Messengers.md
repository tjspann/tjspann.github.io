Though this is not strictly needed for the purposes of this guide, if one were to want or require an encrypted way to communicate that "Big Tech" doesn't control, you can't beat OMEMO encrypted XMPP threads paired with a no-log server. For android, use the Conversations app but *not* the conversations.im server. Simply [search](duck.com) for a "no log xmpp server" and select one with in-band setup. Then use that for the registration server in XMPP. Send all your friends here to get set up as well, then swap XMPP IDs. If it's needed I can make a better guide on how to set up and use.
