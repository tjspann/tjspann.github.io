A crypto faucet is a website or an app that distributes rewards in exchange for viewing ads, captcha completion, and prizes from simple games. That's right, more free crypto. Most of these sites are geared toward you viewing an obscene amount of ads (or at least having them displayed in your browser) so it is up to you whether it is worth it. Some of these sites are hard to navigate or confusing, some lead to a lot of pop ups, some are just outright scary. On the other hand, others are more pleasant to deal with. If you'll be working the taps, I highly recommend doing so on an old computer if you have one available. It is possible, even probable you will want to set it up in a corner somewhere only to be touched once a day.
