Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms in which you can exchange one kind of digital asset for another based on the market value of the given assets. A good exchange will have ways to learn about the crypto they deal in as well as staking for supported crypto. Exchanges also function as a bank or vault in some cases. There are a ton of exchanges so I'll only list a few here.

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/): Right up front on their website they offer $5 USD in BTC, just for signing up. See, I told you there was free money involved. Want more? [Use this link instead](https://www.coinbase.com/join/spann_z7n) and instead of a free $5, we will both get $10 USD in BTC after you buy or transfer $100 USD worth of cash or crypto through your account. It's a little more work for double the free BTC. Still want more? Check out Coinbase Earn,

- [Kraken](): More features than most folks will ever have the need of using. Learn about crypto with a massive video archive, stake a nice range of crypto, margin trading and more. I'm staking Polkadot here.

- [Binance US](https://binance.us): Seems to have a good mix of crypto but doesn't have all of Binance's features on the global market.

These are actually more akin to crypto banking services. Both pay you interest in cryptocurrency. I use both and encourage you to do so as well.

- [Nexo](https://nexo.io/?u=5fb567b98047051ebe62fd9b): Earn up to 6% APR on your idle BTC? Nexo offers up to 12% APR on any crypto they support. They also pre-qualify you for up to $100 Million USD for loans backed by your crypto. (Using this link moves me up in line for the Nexo card)

- [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=e5f174eb): BlockFi offers different interest rates and a slightly slimmer group of crypto than Nexo, but still seems to be a top service. They also offer loans backed by your crypto so this is a good alternative to Nexo. (Using this link moves me up in line for the BlockFi card)
