Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms in which you can exchange one kind of digital asset for another based on the market value of the given assets.  Exchanges also function as a bank or vault in some cases. There are a ton of exchanges so I'll only list a few here.

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/): Right up front on their website they offer $5 USD in BTC, just for signing up. See, I told you there was free money involved. Want more? [Use this link instead](https://www.coinbase.com/join/spann_z7n) and we'll both get $10 USD in BTC after you move $100 USD worth of cash or crypto through your account. It's a little more work for double the free BTC. Still want more? Check out Coinbase Earn, where you can earn up to $150 USD in free crypto by watching short videos to learn about crypto. Some of the courses are locked, just come back and click these links to unlock them after a short wait:

These are actually more akin to crypto banking services.

- [Nexo](https://nexo.io/?u=5fb567b98047051ebe62fd9b): Earn up to 6% APR on your idle BTC? Nexo offers up to 12% APR on any crypto they support. They also pre-qualify you for up to $100 Million USD for loans backed by your crypto. 

- [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=e5f174eb): BlockFi offers different interest rates and a slightly slimmer group of crypto than Nexo, but still seems to be a top service. They also offer loans backed by your crypto so this is a good alternative to Nexo.
