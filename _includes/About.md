I decided to create this site after recently getting into the world of crypto only to stumble onto some... less reputable sites. As a former broadcast engineer and corporate IT specialist, I already understood the value of good cryptography. I'm not some big corporate entity or a scammer trying to make off with any of your money - I'm a regular person just like you. 

I personally deal with every site listed here to ensure that I can inform you of the practices you'll encounter. I also want to know up front whether a site pays before they are listed here. These are my referral links, so I have a vested interest in making sure you're happy with the results you recieve... all without you spending a dime or seeing any ads while you're here.  I look forward to this being a successful relationship! ðŸ¥‚
